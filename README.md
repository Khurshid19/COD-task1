DESCRIPTION: TASK 1 CALCULATOR


A Java calculator program is a simple yet versatile application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It allows users to input numerical values and operators through a graphical user interface (GUI) or command-line interface (CLI) and produces the result of the operation.

At its core, a Java calculator typically consists of several key components:

1. **User Interface (UI)**:
   - Graphical User Interface (GUI): The calculator can have buttons representing numbers, mathematical operators, and other functions like clear, backspace, and equals. The GUI provides an intuitive way for users to interact with the calculator.
   - Command-line Interface (CLI): Alternatively, a calculator can be built with a command-line interface where users input expressions directly as text.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program must be able to handle user input, whether it's through clicking buttons in the GUI or typing expressions in the CLI.
   - Input validation ensures that the calculator can handle various input scenarios without crashing.

3. **Parsing and Evaluation**:
   - The input expression is parsed to identify numbers and operators.
   - Parsing involves breaking down the input into meaningful tokens.
   - Once parsed, the expression is evaluated to produce the result.
   - Evaluation involves applying mathematical rules to perform the required operations.

4. **Arithmetic Operations**:
   - Addition: Combining two or more numbers to find their sum.
   - Subtraction: Finding the difference between two numbers.
   - Multiplication: Repeated addition of one number.
   - Division: Splitting a number into equal parts.

5. **Memory Functions**:
   - Some calculators include memory functions like storing values, recalling stored values, and clearing memory.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - The program should handle errors gracefully, such as division by zero or invalid input.

Here's a basic example of how a Java calculator program might work:

- The user enters an expression, like "5 + 3 * 2".
- The program parses the expression and identifies the numbers (5, 3, 2) and operators (+, *).
- The program evaluates the expression following the order of operations (multiplication before addition) to get the result (11).

Overall, a Java calculator program is an excellent exercise for beginners to practice programming concepts like user input, parsing, evaluation, and error handling while providing a useful tool for performing basic arithmetic calculations.

CONCLUSION:
the Java calculator program provides a functional and versatile tool for performing basic arithmetic operations. Through this project, we've learned about fundamental Java concepts such as object-oriented programming, user input handling, exception handling, and basic GUI development using Swing. By encapsulating operations into methods and classes, we've ensured modularity and extensibility, making the code maintainable and easy to understand. Additionally, incorporating exception handling has enhanced the program's robustness by gracefully handling errors. Overall, this project serves as a practical example of how Java can be used to create useful applications with a combination of simplicity and effectiveness.
